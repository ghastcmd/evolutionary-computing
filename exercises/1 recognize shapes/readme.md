# Recognize shapes of a 20x20 matrix

This contains the code for the recognizing shapes using a perceptron of a 20x20 matrix.

What we aim with this exercise is to recognize shapes of horizontal oriented rectangles with 1 unity of measure of width more than the height.

## File format of training

The file format of training example is formated as follows:

The nxn shape of the matrix, the binary matrix, a line break, then the result if it is the required shape or not.

Example:

4 4 \
0 0 0 0 \
1 1 1 1 \
1 1 1 1 \
1 1 1 1 \
1
