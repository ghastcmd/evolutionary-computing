# The rules applied in the code

Weights are a = +1, b = 0, o = -1 \\
'a' are alignment with the same nitrogenated basis \\
'b' are alignment with different nitrogenated basis \\
'o' are alignment with gaps and nitrogenated basis \\

The weights must preferentially occur at the middle of the sequence
